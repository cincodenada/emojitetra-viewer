EmojiTetra Viewer
=================

This is a viewer for Joe Sondow's delightful Twitter account, [@EmojiTetra](https://twitter.com/emojitetra), which is a block-fitting game controlled by Twitter polls - think Twitch Plays Pokemon, but on Twitter and with Tetris.

Since scrolling through the timeline doesn't give you a great feel for the action, I created this viewer so you can click through the games. Click the `Preview` button above to check out the project.

If you want to peek behind the curtain, this project is on Glitch, so you can do that easily - and even remix it if you like! Click the `Remix your own` button above to open your own copy of the app and start fiddling. To have any tweets you'll have to update the database and authorize the app with Twitter - for now that's an exercise left to the reader. The code is also up on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cincodenada/emojitetra-viewer).

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
